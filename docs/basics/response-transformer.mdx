**Response transformer** is a function that transforms a given mocked response instance. Response transformers are also referred to as "context utilities".

## Standards transformers

The list of custom transformers is exposed in the [`ctx`](/docs/api/context) argument of a response resolver. Refer to the all available transformers on the following page:

<PageLink title="Context" url="/docs/api/context" />

<Hint mode="varning">
  Some response transformers are specific to the type of the API you are mocking
  (i.e. <code>ctx.data</code> is a GraphQL-specific transformer), and may not be
  available when working with a different API type.
</Hint>

## Custom transformer

Let's create a custom response transformer to redirect in the mocked responses:

```js showLineNumbers
// src/mocks/ctx/redirect.js
export function redirect(destination, statusCode) {
  return (res) => {
    res.status = statusCode
    res.headers.set('Location', destination)
    return res
  }
}
```

The `redirect` function above is a custom response transformer: it accepts `destination` and `statusCode`, and returns an applicator function that modifies the mocked response to provision a redirect.

We can use this transformer by providing it as an argument to the `res()` function in a response resolver:

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6
// src/mocks/index.js
import { redirect } from './ctx/redirect'

setupWorker(
  rest.get('/user', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(redirect('/v2/user', 301))
  }),
)
```

### Composing standard transformers

It's recommended to reuse the standard transformers when creating your custom ones. This is how we could rewrite the `redirect` transformer:

```js
// src/mocks/ctx/redirect.js
import { compose, context } from 'msw'

export function redirect(destination, statusCode) {
  return compose(
    context.status(statusCode),
    context.set('Location', destination),
  )
}
```

### Asynchronous transformers

Response transformer may be an asynchronous function, allowing you to perform various side-effects to modify the mocked response.

```js
// src/mocks/ctx/jpeg.js
import { compose, context } from 'msw'

async function jpeg(base64) {
  // Converting a Base64 image to buffer via `fetch`
  // is an asynchronous action.
  const buffer = await fetch(base64).then((res) => res.arrayBuffer())

  return compose(
    context.set('Content-Length', buffer.byteLength.toString())
    context.set('Content-Type', 'image/jpeg'),
    context.body(buffer)
  )
}
```
