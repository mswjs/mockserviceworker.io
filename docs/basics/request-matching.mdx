To determine which outgoing requests should be mocked, Mock Service Worker performs request matchingâ€”a process of executing a request handler predicate against the actual request.

<Hint>
  Requests with no corresponding request handlers are performed as-is
  (bypassed).
</Hint>

Request matching substantially differs based on the request handler (`rest`/`graphql`) that's being used. See the summary of that difference between the standard request handlers of the library below.

## REST API

Working with `rest.*` request handlers allows you to match requests by the following criteria:

- Request method;
- Request URL.

<Hint mode="warning">
  Query parameters and hashes are removed from the URL during matching.
</Hint>

### Request method

To match REST API requests by their method call the respective method on the `rest` request handler object. Here's a few examples:

- `rest.get()` matches `GET` requests;
- `rest.delete()` matches `DELETE` requests.

### Request URL

There are multiple ways to match a REST API request by its URL:

- Provide an exact request URL;
- Use a path;
- Use a RegExp.

#### Exact request URL

Provided an exact request URL string, only those request that strictly match that string are mocked.

```js
// Only "POST https://api.backend.dev/users" requests match this handler
rest.post('https://api.backend.dev/users', responseResolver)

// Given your application runs on "http://localhost:8080",
// this request handler URL gets resolved to "http://localhost:8080/invoices"
rest.get('/invoices', invocesResolver)
```

> Note that relative URL are resolved against the current location (`location.origin`).

#### Path

Mock Service Worker uses an Express-like path syntax to match requests.

Path is an abstraction over regular expression for shorthand wildcard and path parameters definition. See the examples of using paths below.

##### Path with wildcard

```js
// Matches:
// - /users/admin
// - /users/octocat
rest.get('/users/*', responseResolver),
```

> Note that prepending a wildcard to a path would capture requests _regardless of origin_. You rarely want to do something like `*/users`, as it may easily produce ambiguous matches.

##### Path with parameters

To add a parameter to your request path use the `:paramName` format. Parsed parameters values is available in the `req.params` object of the response resolver.

```js focusedLines=5
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'

setupWorker(
  // Given "POST https://api.backend.dev/user/abc-123" request,
  rest.post('https://api.backend.dev/user/:userId', (req, res, ctx) => {
    // `userId` value becomes "abc-123"
    const { userId } = req.params
  }),
)
```

### RegExp

When provided a regular expression, all request URL that match that expression will be captured, regardless of the their origin.

```js
// This request handler would match all these requests:
// - DELETE http://localhost:8080/posts/
// - DELETE https://backend.dev/user/posts/
rest.delete(/\/posts\//, responseResolver)
```

> Unlike paths, regular expressions use _weak_ comparison, supporting partial matches.

## GraphQL API

Working with `graphql.*` request handlers allows you to match GraphQL requests (operations) by the following criteria:

- Operation kind (query/mutation);
- Operation name.

> Both `GET` and `POST` requests are supported according to the GraphQL specification.

  title="Learn more about the GraphQL request handlers"
/>

### Operation kind

Execute a method of the `graphql` request handler object that corresponds to a GraphQL operation kind to target operations of that kind. For example:

- `graphql.query()` to match GraphQL queries;
- `graphql.mutation()` to match GraphQL mutations.

### Operation name

By default, all GraphQL operation names are matched _regardless of origin_.

```js
// This will match a "GetUser" operation against any host
// (i.e. both "https://api.github.com/v4" and "http://localhost:8080")
graphql.query('GetUser', resolveUser)
```

> Use [`graphql.link`](/docs/api/graphql/link) to target GraphQL operations against a specific endpoint.

#### RegExp

You can use a regular expression to match multiple GraphQL operation names.

```js
// Matches all GraphQL queries that end with "User".
graphql.query(/User$/, resolveAnyUserQuery)
```
