title: Life-cycle events
order: 61
---

The life-cycle events API is designed to execute arbitrary logic in response to internal MSW events, such as the start and end of a request, or the mocked/original response. This is primarily useful for third-party extension developers, or while debugging request handlers.

<Hint>
  This API is <strong>not meant for mocking</strong>. Use{' '}
  <a href="/docs/api/setup-worker">
    <code>setupWorker</code>
  </a>
  /<a href="/docs/api/setup-server">
    <code>setupServer</code>
  </a> instead.

## Events list

### Request events

```js
// A new request has been dispatched.
worker.on('request:start', (req) => {})
// Request has a corresponding request handler.
worker.on('request:match', (req) => {})
// Request doesn't have any corresponding request handlers.
worker.on('request:unhandled', (req) => {})
// Request has concluded (regardless of the response).
worker.on('request:end', (req) => {})
```

### Response events

```js
// Mocked response has been sent to a request with a given `reqId`.
worker.on('response:mocked', (res, reqId) => {})
// Original response has been sent to a request with a given `reqId`.
worker.on('response:bypass', (res, reqId) => {})
```

> The same events can be listened to on a `server` instance of `setupServer`.

### Tracking a request

Each life-cycle event emits in isolation. To connect multiple events with a single request, the library exposes a request ID (`reqId`)â€”a UUID that persists with a specific request.

```js focusedLines=5-6,10-11
const allRequests = new Map()

worker.on('request:start', (req) => {
  const { id } = req
  // Store this request by id in an internal Map.
  allRequests.set(id, req)
})

worker.on('response:mocked', (res, reqId) => {
  // Get a request associated with this response.
  const req = allRequests.get(reqId)
})
```
