title: Life-cycle events
order: 61

Life-cycle events API is designed to execute arbitrary logic in response to internal MSW events, such as request start/end, or mocked/original response. This is primarily useful for third-party extensions developers and during request handlers debugging.

<Hint>
  This API is <strong>not meant for mocking</strong>. Use{' '}
  <a href="/docs/api/setup-worker">
    <code>setupWorker</code>
  </a>
  /<a href="/docs/api/setup-server">
    <code>setupServer</code>
  </a> instead.

## Events list

### Request events

```js
// A new request has been dispatched.
worker.on('request:start', (req) => {})
// Request has a corresponding request handler.
worker.on('request:match', (req) => {})
// Request doesn't have any corresponding request handlers.
worker.on('request:unhandled', (req) => {})
// Request has concluded (regardless of the response).
worker.on('request:end', (req) => {})
```

### Response events

```js
// Mocked response has been sent to a request with given `reqId`.
worker.on('response:mocked', (res, reqId) => {})
// Original response has been sent to a request with given `reqId`.
worker.on('response:bypass', (res, reqId) => {})
```

> The same events can be listened to on a `server` instance of `setupServer`.

### Tracking a request

Each life-cycle event emits in isolation. To connect multiple events with a single request the library exposes a request IDâ€”a UUID that persist with a specific request.

```js focusedLines=5-6,10-11
const allRequests = new Map()

worker.on('request:start', (req) => {
  const { id } = req
  // Store this request by id in the internal Map.
  allRequests.set(id, req)
})

worker.on('response:mocked', (res, reqId) => {
  // Get a request associated with this response.
  const req = allRequests.get(reqId)
})
```
