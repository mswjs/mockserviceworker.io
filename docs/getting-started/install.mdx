In this basic tutorial we are going to add Mock Service Worker to an existing [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) application. You can follow the same steps from this tutorial to integrate MSW into your application regardless of the setup you have.

## Install

Let's start by installing the `msw` package into our project.

<Action>Run the following command in your project's root directory:</Action>

```bash
npm install msw --save-dev
# or
yarn add msw --dev
```

## Next step

With the library installed, let's continue with defining which requests to mock.

import * as MockPage from './mocks'

<PageLink page={MockPage} url="/docs/getting-started/mocks" />
