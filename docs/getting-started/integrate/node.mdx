One of the most common usages of Mock Service Worker in Node is utilizing our request handlers for integration tests. We are going to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as a test runner. Following the same principle, you can integrate mocking into any Node process.

## Setup

It's recommended to configure API mocking as a part of your tests teardown, so that your tests don't have to reference any mocking during their runs, focusing on testing what matters.

## Configure server

Let's create a file in our mock definition directory (`src/mocks`) where we would configure our request mocking server.

<Action>
  Create a <code>src/mocks/server.js</code> file:
</Action>

```bash
$ touch src/mocks/server.js
```

In the `server.js` file we are going to create a server instance with our request handlers defined earlier.

<Action>
  Import <code>setupServer</code> function from the <code>msw/node</code> package and
  create a server instance with previously defined request handlers
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=2,7-8
// src/mocks/server.js
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

// This configures a request mocking server with the given request handlers.
export const server = setupServer(...handlers)
```

### Using Create React App

In Create React App there is a `src/setupTests.js` module that is used as a Jest teardown configuration.

<Action>
  Modify the <code>src/setupTests.js</code> tests teardown file:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers
// src/setupTests.js
import { server } from './mocks/server.js'

// Establish API mocking before all tests.
beforeAll(() => server.listen())

// Reset any request handlers that we may add during the tests,
// so they don't affect other tests.
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())

// Clean up after the tests are finished.
afterAll(() => server.close())
```

<Hint>
  You can use the same code as above in a single test suite, if you don't wish
  to establish API mocking on the global level.
</Hint>

### Using manual setup

If you are not using CRA, please create a custom teardown module and reference it using Jest's [`setupFiles`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#setupfiles-array) option in your `jest.config.js`.

<Action>
  Create a <code>jest.setup.js</code> test teardown file:
</Action>

```bash
$ touch jest.setup.js
```

Open the `jest.setup.js` file and write there the same code as in the Create React App `src/setupTests.js` example above.

<Action>
  Reference the teardown file in <code>jest.config.js</code>:
</Action>

```js
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  setupFiles: ['jest.setup.js'],
}
```

> Create `jest.config.js`, if you don't have it already.

## Run tests

Since API mocking has been established in the tests teardown, each test suite doesn't need any extra adjustments to intercept and mock API requests according to your handlers.

```js showLineNumbers
// test/Login.test.js

test('allows user to log in', async () => {
  // Render components, perform requests, receive mocked responses.
})
```
