In this integration example we are going to use mocking during the unit testing with a [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework. Following the same principle, you can integrate mocking into any Node process.

## Setup

As the first step, let's export our mock definitions so they can be accessed in our test suite.

<Action>
  Export the <code>mocks</code> definition from the <code>mocks.js</code> file:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6
// src/mocks.js
import { /* rest, or graphql */ } from 'msw'

const mocks = [...]

export { mocks }
```

Now let's create a test suite and import our mock definition there, as well as the server setup function from the library.

<Action>
  Import <code>setupServer</code> function from the <code>msw/node</code> package:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=2-3
// test/login.test.js
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { mocks } from '../mocks'
```

## Start the server

To start the mocking server call the `setupServer` function and provide the mock definitions to it.

<Hint>
  Internally, Mock Service Worker does not establish any servers. The term
  "server" has been chosen to provide familiar interface and describe the
  seeming functionality.
</Hint>
<Action>
  Pass the mock definitions to the <code>setupServer</code> function:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6
// test/login.test.js
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { mocks } from '../mocks'

describe('Login', () => {
  const server = setupServer(...mocks)
})
```

Now to enable the mocking we need to call the `listen()` method on the server. Alternatively, we can stop the mocking by calling the `close()` method (for example, during the test's cleanup).

<Action>
  Control the mocking with <code>server.listen()</code> and{' '}
  <code>server.close()</code>:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=9,13
// test/login.test.js
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { mocks } from '../mocks'

describe('Login', () => {
  const server = setupServer(mocks)

  beforeAll(() => {
    server.listen()
  })

  afterAll(() => {
    server.close()
  })

  describe('given I logged in', () => {
    /* perform requests and test the application's behavior */
  })
})
```
