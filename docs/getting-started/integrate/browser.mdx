## Setup

Mock Service Worker operates client-side by registering a [Service Worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers) responsible for requests interception. However, we don't have to write any of the worker's code by ourselves, but rather copy the worker file distributed by the library. Mock Service Worker provides a dedicated CLI to help us do that.

<Action>
  Execute the <code>init</code> command of the Mock Service Worker CLI:
</Action>

```bash
$ npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR>
```

Replace the `<PUBLIC_DIR>` placeholder with the relative path to your server's public directory. For example, in a Create React App project this command would be:

```bash
$ npx msw init public/
```

import PublicDirSnippet from "../../snippets/public-dir.mdx";

<PublicDirSnippet />

## Configure worker

Let's create a file in our mock definition directory (`src/mocks`) where we would configure and start our Service Worker.

<Action>
  Create a <code>src/mocks/browser.js</code> file:
</Action>

```bash
$ touch src/mocks/browser.js
```

In the `browser.js` file we are going to create a worker instance with our request handlers defined earlier.

<Action>
  Import <code>setupWorker</code> function from the <code>msw</code> package and
  create a worker instance with previously defined request handlers
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=2,7-8
// src/mocks/browser.js
import { setupWorker } from "msw";
import { handlers } from "./handlers";

// This configures a Service Worker with the given request handlers.
export const worker = setupWorker(...handlers);
```

## Start worker

In order for our mock definition to execute during the runtime, it needs to be imported into our application's code. However, since mocking is a development-oriented technique, we will be importing our `src/mocks/browser.js` file _conditionally_, depending on the current environment.

<Hint mode="warning">
  It's <strong>not recommended</strong> to include Mock Service Worker in
  production. Doing so may lead to a distorted experience for your users.
</Hint>
<Action>
  Import the <code>src/mocks/browser.js</code> file conditionally following one
  of the examples below:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6-9
// src/index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  const { worker } = require("./mocks/browser");
  worker.start();
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

## Verify & Inspect

After importing the mock definition, you should see a successful activation message from Mock Service Worker in your browser's console:

<ConsoleMessage>[MSW] Mocking enabled</ConsoleMessage>

Any requests that match previously defined handlers will now be intercepted and mocked.

## Troubleshooting

If you have created a project using Create React App you should remove the following line

```js
serviceWorker.unregister();
```

in your `src/index.js` file. Create React App unregisters all Service Workers by default, which would also unregister the mock Service Worker, resulting into broken requests interception.
