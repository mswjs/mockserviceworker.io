title: Mocking GraphQL API
order: 23

## Pre-requisites

Since we will be working with a GraphQL API, we need to have a GraphQL client installed and configured in our application. We need that client primarily to dispatch queries and mutations. Please refer to the getting started steps of the respective client.

<Action>Install and configure a GraphQL client</Action>

Here are some GraphQL clients to consider:

- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/)

### Supported clients

Any GraphQL client that complies with the GraphQL operations specification can be used with Mock Service Worker. A client must dispatch requests with the following signature:

```ts
interface GraphQLRequest {
  query: string;
  variables?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

<Hint>
  Some GraphQL clients append extra information to the request's payload. That
  information will be available in the response resolver function.
</Hint>

## Imports

In our `src/mocks/handlers.js` file let's import the essentials we need for mocking a GraphQL API. They are grouped under the `graphql` namespace exposed by the library.

<Action>
  Import <code>graphql</code> from the <code>msw</code> package:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { graphql } from "msw";
```

## Request handler

To handle a GraphQL request we need to specify its _operation kind_ (query/mutation).

In this tutorial we will be mocking a basic login flow for our user. This flow implies handling two operations:

- `Login` mutation, to allow a user to log in,
- `GetUserInfo` query, to return the information about the logged in user.

<Action>
  Create request handlers by calling <code>graphql[OPERATION_KIND]</code> and
  providing an operation name:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6,9
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { graphql } from "msw";

export const handlers = [
  // Handles a "Login" mutation
  graphql.mutation("Login", null),

  // Handles a "GetUserInfo" query
  graphql.query("GetUserInfo", null),
];
```

## Response resolver

To respond to an operation using a mocked response we have to specify it using a response resolver function.

Response resolver is a function that accepts the following arguments:

- `req`, an information about a matching request;
- `res`, a functional utility to create the mocked response;
- `ctx`, a group of functions that help to set a status code, headers, data, etc. on the mocked response.

In GraphQL we describe the expected response in a query/mutation declaration itself. Let's design the shape of our response for both operations:

```graphql
# Authenticates using a given username
mutation Login($username: String!) {
  login(username: $username) {
    username
  }
}
```

```graphql
# Returns the information about the authenticated user
query GetUserInfo() {
  user {
    username
    firstName
  }
}
```

<Action>
  Provide response resolvers to the previously defined request handlers:
</Action>

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=10-16,25-30,34-41
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { graphql } from "msw";

export const handlers = [
  // Handles a "Login" mutation
  graphql.mutation("Login", (req, res, ctx) => {
    const { username } = req.variables;
    sessionStorage.setItem("is-authenticated", username);

    return res(
      ctx.data({
        login: {
          username,
        },
      })
    );
  }),

  // Handles a "GetUserInfo" query
  graphql.query("GetUserInfo", (req, res, ctx) => {
    const authenticatedUser = sessionStorage.getItem("is-authenticated");

    if (!authenticatedUser) {
      // When not authenticated, respond with an error
      return res(
        ctx.errors([
          {
            message: "Not authenticated",
            errorType: "AuthenticationError",
          },
        ])
      );
    }

    // When authenticated, respond with a query payload
    return res(
      ctx.data({
        user: {
          username: authenticatedUser,
          firstName: "John",
        },
      })
    );
  }),
];
```

> Utilize things like [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage), [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), or [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) to handle more complex API scenarios and user interactions.

## Next step

The request handlers are complete, yet there is one last step to perform: integrate the mocking.
