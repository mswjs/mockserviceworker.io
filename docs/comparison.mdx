| Definition     | Response mocking through method chaining.                                                                                    | Response mocking through functional composition.                                                          |

> Nock is a great tool for combining API mocking and assertions in NodeJS. NodeJS API of Mock Service Worker functions similarly to Nock, but allows you to reuse the same mock definition in browser as well.

## JSON Server

[`JSON Server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) allows you to create an actual HTTP server based on a JSON file.

| Criteria       | JSON Server                                                                        | Mock Service Worker                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Definition     | Mocks are defined using a custom JSON file, being a separate context.              | Mocks are defined in a client-side JavaScript, allowing to reuse actual logic, typings, utilities.                                                                                                             |

> JSON Server is an actual HTTP server based on an abstract definition. Mock Service Worker is a Service Worker intercepting actual requests your application makes.

## MirageJS

[`MirageJS`](https://github.com/miragejs/miragejs) is a mocking library that is highly focused on data relation, and allows to model dynamic scenarios similar to those of an actual production server.

| Criteria       | MirageJS                                                                                      | Mock Service Worker                                                                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supported API  | REST                                                                                          | REST / GraphQL                                                                                     |
| Environments   | Browser                                                                                       | Node / Browser                                                                                     |
| Implementation | Intercepts requests on the application level by stubbing native `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest`. | Intercepts requests on the network level using Service Worker API.                                 |
| Integration    | Does not require any changes to an existing code.                                             | Does not require any changes to an existing code.                                                  |
| Definition     | Uses OOP and ORM oriented declaration of mocks. Provides rich tools for data modelling.       | Uses functional declaration of routes and responses. Non-opinionated in regards to data modelling. |

> MirageJS has a focus on data relation during mocking. Mock Service Worker, on the other hand, conducts API mocking on per-transaction basis, making mocking a matter of request-response relation.

## Service Mocker

[Service Mocker](https://github.com/service-mocker/service-mocker/) is another library that leverages the Service Worker API for the purpose of mocking. Although both libraries share a similar idea, their implementations differ.

| Criteria       | Service Mocker                                                                                                                                         | Mock Service Worker                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Supported API  | REST                                                                                                                                                   | REST / GraphQL                                                                       |
| Environments   | Browser                                                                                                                                                | Node / Browser                                                                       |
| Implementation | Registers a Service Worker. Resolves mocked responses as a part of the worker.                                                                         | Registers a Service Worker. Resolves mocked responses on the client side.            |
| Integration    | Requires to have the build worker file at the proper scope. May require `sw-loader`, or configuring the `Service-Worker-Allowed` header on the server. | Does not require any changes to the build setup.                                     |
| Definition     | Mocking logic is written in a separate `server.js` file (in a Service Worker's context), dettached from your app's logic.                              | Mocks are defined in a client-side JavaScript, allowing to reuse actual app's logic. |

### Service Worker operation

Since both libraries operate using Service Worker, it's resonable to compare the difference in how they handle their worker instance.

#### Scope

Service Worker is registered for a specific scope on the website. For example, a worker registered on a `/products` path cannot affect anything happening on a `/contacts` page. The scope of a worker is defined by _the location of the worker file_.

| Service Mocker                                                                                                                                   | Mock Service Worker                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Leverages a dedicated `Service-Worker-Allowed` header to control a worker's scope. Requires access to the build configuration to set the header. | Encourages to register a Service Worker in the root of your application (by running `npx msw init` shorthand command). |

#### Cookies

Setting cookies on a mocked `Response` instance is forbidden by security reasons.

| Service Mocker                                       | Mock Service Worker                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No support for setting cookies on a mocked response. | Imitates setting cookies on a response by writing to `document.cookie` directly. Read more about [mocking cookies](/docs/recipes/cookies). |

#### Hard reload

Per specification, a hard reload of a page stops any Service Worker execution until the next reload. Needless to say, this results into an unpleasant mocking experience.

| Service Mocker               | Mock Service Worker                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Does not handle hard reload. | Overcomes this issue by scheduling a regular `location.reload()` once a hard reload is detected. |

#### Multi-project support

Since Service Worker controls a page at a given host and port, opening a different project on the same port may result into Service Worker still attempting to process irrelevant requests.

| Service Mocker                                                                                                           | Mock Service Worker                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Does not support multiple projects on the same port. Requires to unregister the Service Worker manually in your browser. | Supports multiple projects on the same port by detecting when the last client is closed, unregistering the Service Worker automatically. |
