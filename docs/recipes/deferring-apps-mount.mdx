title: Deferring app's mount
---

Registering a Service Worker is an asynchronous action, which means that any HTTP request that happens between calling `worker.start()` and the worker registration cannot be intercepted by the library. By default MSW captures all outgoing requests in that pending period and defers their execution until the worker is ready to handle them.

> Learn more about the [`waitUntilReady`](/docs/api/setup-worker/start#waituntilready) option.

However, in case when such default behavior is insufficient or undesired, you may defer your application's mounting manually. Since `worker.start()` returns a promise, you can execute your application bootstrapping logic once that promise resolves.

Here's an example on how to defer application's mount in a React application:

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=7-10,15
// src/index.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'

function prepare() {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    const { worker } = require('./mocks/browser')
    return worker.start()
  }

  return Promise.resolve()
}

prepare.then(() => {
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElememtById('root'))
})
```

  , and use this recipe only when the default setup doesn't cover your needs.
