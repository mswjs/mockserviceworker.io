title: delay()
order: 579
---

Delays the response by the given duration (in ms). When no duration is provided, uses a random realistic server response time.

> Realistic response time is a random duration based on the average response time of a real server, considering a good connection.

## Call signature

```ts
function delay(duration?: number): MockedResponse
```

## Examples

### Explicit response delay

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=3-4
rest.post('/login', (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(
    // Delays response for 2000ms.
    ctx.delay(2000),
    ctx.json({
      id: 'abc-123',
    }),
  )
})
```

### Implicit response delay

When no delay duration is explicitly provided, Mock Service Worker uses a random realistic server response time on the particular mocked response.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=3
rest.delete('/post/:postId', (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(
    ctx.delay(),
    ctx.json({
      message: `Post ${req.params.postId} successfully deleted!`,
    }),
  )
})
```
