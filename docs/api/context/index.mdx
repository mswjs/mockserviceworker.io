**Context** (`ctx`) argument of a response resolver contains a set of helper functions for working with various API types and mocking patterns.

## Request handler specificity

Context is specific to the request handler being used. For example, you cannot access the `ctx.data()` method when using `rest.*` request handlers, because it's specific to GraphQL API and is available only in the `graphql.*` handlers.
