A request handler that targets any GraphQL operation, regardless of type or name.

## Call signature

```ts
interface graphql {
  operation(resolver: ResponseResolver): RequestHandler;
}
```

## Examples

### Fixed response

```js focusedLines=3
import { graphql } from "msw";

graphql.operation((req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(
    ctx.errors([
      {
        message: "Access denied",
        positions: [1, 92],
      },
    ])
  );
});
```

### Resolve against schema

You can resolve any operation against a predefined schema, opposed to a fixed response. Here's an example of using the `graphql` package to resolve an operation against a predefined `schema`:

```js focusedLines=16
import { graphql as graphqlRequest, buildSchema } from "graphql";
import { graphql } from "msw";

const schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`);

const root = {
  hello: () => {
    return "Hello world!";
  },
};

graphql.operation(async (req, res, ctx) => {
  const payload = await graphqlRequest(
    schema,
    req.body.query,
    root,
    null,
    req.variables
  );

  return res(ctx.data(payload.data), ctx.errors(payload.errors));
});
```
