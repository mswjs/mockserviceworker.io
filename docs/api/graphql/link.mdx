title: link()
order: 544
---

A high-order request handler that scopes a [GraphQL API](/docs/api/graphql/) under the given endpoint.

`graphql.link()` is primarily designed for applications that communicate with multiple GraphQL endpoints to prevent operation name collision during API mocking.

## Call signature

```ts
interface graphql {
  link(uri: string): GraphQLRequestHandlers;
}
```

## Examples

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=3-4,7-8
import { setupWorker, graphql } from "msw";

const github = graphql.link("https://api.github.com/v4");
const stripe = graphql.link("https://api.stripe.com/graphql");

const worker = setupWorker(
  github.query("GetUser", resolveGitHubUser),
  stripe.mutation("Payment", resolveStripePayment),

  // Although this operation name is `GetUser`,
  // it will get captured only when the request is issued
  // against the current location (no link specified).
  graphql.query("GetUser", (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res();
  })
);

worker.start();
```
