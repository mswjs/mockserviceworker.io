A request handler that captures a GraphQL mutation by the given name.

<Hint mode="warning">
  This request handler captures GraphQL mutations regardless of their endpoint.
  See{" "}
  <a href="/docs/api/graphql/link">
    <code>graphql.link()</code>
  </a>{" "}
  for the endpoint-based mocking.
</Hint>

## Call signature

```ts
interface graphql {
  mutation<MutationType, VariablesType>(
    name: string | RegExp,
    resolver: ResponseResolver
  ): RequestHandler;
}
```

## Examples

### Basic mutation

```graphql
mutation Logout {
  user {
    sessionId
  }
}
```

To capture a GraphQL mutation provide its name as the first argument to the `graphql.mutation()` request handler. Using the mutation definition above, the request handler for it would look as follows:

```js focusedLines=3
import { graphql } from "msw";

graphql.mutation("Logout", (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(
    ctx.data({
      user: {
        sessionId: "abc-123",
      },
    })
  );
});
```

### Mutation variables

```graphql focusedLines=1
mutation Login($username: String!, $password: String!) {
  login(username: $username, password: $password) {
    sessionId
  }
}
```

> Variables must be correctly defined in the GraphQL mutation definition in order to be accessible in mocks. Refer to the [GraphQL Variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables) for more information.

Use `req.variables` object to access all the variables of the captured mutation.

```js focusedLines=4
import { graphql } from "msw";

graphql.mutation("Logout", (req, res, ctx) => {
  const { username, password } = req.variables;

  return res(
    ctx.data({
      login: {
        sessionId: "abc-123",
      },
    })
  );
});
```

### Dynamic mutation name

When given a `RegExp` as the mutation name, all the GraphQL mutations that match that expression would be captured by this request handler.

```graphql
mutation CreateUser {
  user {
    id
  }
}

mutation DeleteUser {
  user {
    id
  }
}
```

```js focusedLines=3
import { graphql } from "msw";

graphql.mutation(/^(.+?)User$/, (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(
    ctx.errors([
      {
        message: "Not authorized",
      },
    ])
  );
});
```

### Usage with TypeScript

Annotate your mutations in TypeScript to get autocompletion and validation for mutation data and variables in your IDE.

```ts
import { graphql } from "msw";

interface LoginMutation {
  user: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
  };
}

interface LoginMutationVariables {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}

graphql.mutation<LoginMutation, LoginMutationVariables>(
  "Login",
  (req, res, ctx) => {
    const { username, password } = req.variables;

    return res(
      ctx.data({
        user: {
          firstName: "John",
          lastName: "Maverick",
        },
      })
    );
  }
);
```
