Prints the list of currently active request handlers into the `stdout` of the running process.

## Example

```js
// handlers.js
import { rest } from 'msw'
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'

const server = setupServer(
  rest.get('/user/:userId', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({ id: req.params.userId }))
  }),
)
```

To list all the active request handlers run the following command:

```js
server.printHandlers()
```

Each request handler outputted into the console contains the following information:

- Request method (`GET`) and path (`/user/:userId`).
- Declaration frame (`handlers.js@5:8`) you can click to navigate to the place in your code where you declare this handler.
