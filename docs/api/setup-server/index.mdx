A function that sets up a request interception layer in NodeJS environment.

<Hint>
  This function is designed for NodeJS environment. If looking for a way to
  apply API mocking in a browser environment, consider using{' '}
  <a href="/docs/api/setup-worker">
    <code>setupWorker</code>
  </a>{' '}
  instead.
</Hint>

## Operation

Since Service Worker API cannot run in a non-browser environment, the NodeJS support of request interception is done via a designated [`node-request-interceptor`](https://github.com/mswjs/node-request-interceptor) library.

> Although there is "server" in `setupServer`, the library does not establish any actual servers, but operates by augmenting native request issuing modules (such as `https` or `XMLHttpRequest`). The namespace is chosen for what the logic _represents_, not how it works internally.

### Limitations

There may be certain limitations when reusing request handlers between client and server. For example, if your request handler operates with `localStorage`, it wouldn't do so in NodeJS environment, because that API is specific to a browser.

Here are some pieces of advice on how to handle such limitations:

- Introduce any necessary polyfills for browser-specific APIs.
- Break down a response resolver into set of independent functions. That way you can omit the functions that are meant for a browser, and optionally substitude them with compatible NodeJS replacements.

## Examples

Typically, `setupServer` is used for unit and integration tests, however, it will run in any NodeJS process.

Here's an example of the integration test using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and Mock Service Worker to provide a seamless API mocking:

```js showLineNumbers
import { rest } from 'msw'
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'

const server = setupServer(
  // Describe the requests to mock.
  rest.get('/book/:bookId', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.json({
        title: 'Lord of the Rings',
        author: 'J. R. R. Tolkien',
      }),
    )
  }),
)

beforeAll(() => {
  // Establish requests interception layer before all tests.
  server.listen()
})

afterAll(() => {
  // Clean up after all tests are done, preventing this
  // interception layer from affecting irrelevant tests.
  server.close()
})

test('renders a book data', () => {
  // Render components, perform requests, API communication is covered.
})
```
