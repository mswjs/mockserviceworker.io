Cleans up any agumented native request issuing classes and stops request interception.

## Examples

It's recommended to call `.close()` after all test suites to clean up and prevent the current interception layer from affecting irrelevant tests.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'

const server = setupServer(...)

beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterAll(() => server.close())
```
