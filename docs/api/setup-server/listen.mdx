Establishes a request interception instance previously configured via `setupServer`.

## Examples

In typical a testing setup you call `.listen()` in a setup hook before all your tests, making sure the request interception is at place once the test suits run.

Here's an example of using `.listen()` with Jest's `beforeAll` hook:

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'

const server = setupServer(/* request handlers */)

beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen()
})
```

> Unlike a similar method on actual servers, `.listen()` operates synchronously, because there is no servers and, thus, no actual connection to establish.
