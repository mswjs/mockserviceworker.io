**Response** (`res`) is a function that composes a mocked response object.

Unlike the `Response` object in NodeJS, the `res` argument in Mock Service Worker is used to create and transform a mocked response. When called, it passes a created response from one [response transformer](/docs/basics/response-transformer) to another, eventually resolving to a mocked response used by the Service Worker.

## Mocked response

A call to the `res()` function creates a mocked response object. Each response transformer accepted by the `res()` function modifies that mocked response and passes it to the next response transformer, thus, creating a functional composition.

| Property name | Type                                                                          | Description                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`      | `number`                                                                      | Mocked response HTTP status code. (_Default:_ `200`)          |
| `statusText`  | `string`                                                                      | HTTP status text of the current status code.                  |
| `body`        | `string`                                                                      | Stringified body of the response.                             |
| `headers`     | [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers/Headers) | Mocked response HTTP headers.                                 |
| `delay`       | `number`                                                                      | Delay duration (ms) before responding with a mocked response. |

## Example

### Standard usage

```js showLineNumbers
rest.get('/users', (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(
    // This response transformer sets a custom status text on the response.
    ctx.status(301),
    // While this one appends a "Content-Type" response header.
    ctx.set('Content-Type', 'application/json'),
  )
})
```

### Raw usage

The `res()` call can accept a function that modifies and returns a created mocked response instance. It's recommended, however, to use standard response transformers for faster reference and reliability.

```js showLineNumbers
rest.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  return res((res) => {
    res.status = 301
    res.headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json')
    return res
  })
})
```

### Custom response composition

Usually the `res` function is available as an argument of a request handler. However, in some cases (like building a custom response composition) it's useful to import the `res` function directly, outside of the request handler's scope.

You can do that by importing the `response` function from the `msw` package:

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=2,7
// src/mocks/res.js
import { response, context } from 'msw'

export function res(...transformers) {
  // A custom response composition chain that embeds
  // a random realistic server response delay to each `res()` call.
  return response(...transformers, context.delay())
}
```

Such custom response composition can later be used when creating a mocked response in a request handler:

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=3,9
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'
import { res } from './res'

const worker = setupWorker(
  rest.get('/user', (req, _, ctx) => {
    // Notice how this response resolver is using a custom `res` function
    // imported at the top of this module.
    return res(ctx.json({ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Maverick' }))
  }),
)

worker.start()
```
