Emulates a network error during the response. Cancels the respective request.

### Intended vs unintended exceptions

The `res.networkError()` call produces an intended exception, as opposed to a `throw` statement within a request handler, which is considered an unintended exception. Such differentiation is necessary to catch and surface exceptions early during your request handling logic.

Read more about exceptions handling on the [Mocking error responses](/docs/recipes/mocking-error-responses) page.

## Examples

The request handler below produces a network error in response to the `GET /books` request:

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=2
rest.get('/books', (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res.networkError('Failed to connect')
})
```
