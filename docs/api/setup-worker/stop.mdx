Stops the mocking for the current client.

## Usage

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=11
// src/mocks.js
import { setupWorker } from 'msw'

const worker = setupWorker(...mocks)

// Start the worker by default
worker.start()

// Write the stop method on the window
// to access during runtime.
window.__mswStop = worker.stop
```

Calling `window.__mswStop()` in the browser would disable the mocking for the current page.

<Hint>
  The mocking's disabled state does not persist between page reloads. When the
  page is refreshed, its JavaScript code will run again, calling{' '}
  <code>worker.start()</code>, thus, enabling the mocking.
