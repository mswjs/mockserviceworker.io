title: start()
order: 511
---

Registers and activates the Service Worker instance responsible for requests interception.

## Options

### `serviceWorker`

#### `url`

- `string` (default: `"/mockServiceWorker.js"`)

Custom Service Worker registration URL.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=6
const worker = setupWorker(...)

worker.start({
  serviceWorker: {
    // Points to the custom location of the Service Worker file.
    url: '/assets/mockServiceWorker.js'
  }
})
```

<Hint mode="warning">
  Note that the <code>url</code> path is relative to the server's root
  directory.
</Hint>

#### `options`

- `RegistrationOptions`

Custom Service Worker registration options.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=5-9
const worker = setupWorker(...)

worker.start({
  serviceWorker: {
    options: {
      // Narrow the scope of the Service Worker to intercept requests
      // only from pages under this path.
      scope: '/product'
    }
  }
})
```

---

### `quiet`

- `boolean` (default: _false_)

Disables the logging of matched requests in a browser's console.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=4
const worker = setupWorker(...)

worker.start({
  quiet: true,
})
```

---

### `waitUntilReady`

- `boolean` (default: _true_)

Defers any application requests that happened while Service Worker was activating.

<Hint mode="warning">
  Disabling this behavior is <strong>not recommended</strong>, as that would
  create a race condition between the Service Worker registration and your
  application's runtime.
</Hint>

---

### `onUnhandledRequest`

- `"bypass" | "warn" | "error" | (req: MockedRequest) => void`
- (default: `"bypass"`)

Specifies how to handle a request that is not listed in the request handlers.

#### Pre-defined behaviors

| Option name | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `"bypass"`  | Performs an unhandled request as-is.         |
| `"warn"`    | Produces a warning in the browser's console. |
| `"error"`   | Produces an error in the browser's console.  |

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=8
const worker = setupWorker(
  rest.get('/books', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({ title: 'The Lord of the Rings' }))
  }),
)

worker.start({
  onUnhandledRequest: 'warn',
})
```

#### Custom callback

When passed a function as a value of this option, the library executes that function whenever an unhandled request occurs. The behavior of such unhandled request won't be affected, but can be prevented if the custom callback function throws an exception.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=8
const worker = setupWorker(
  rest.get('/books', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({ title: 'The Lord of the Rings' }))
  }),
)

worker.start({
  onUnhandledRequest(req) {
    console.error(
      'Found an unhandled %s request to %s',
      req.method,
      req.url.href,
    )
  },
})
```

## Operation

### Reusing worker

When `start()` is called, it looks up an existing worker instance for the given client, and updates it, if found.

### Registering worker

When there is no worker instance controlling the current client, it registers a new Service Worker from the given `StartOptions.url` for the `StartOptions.scope`. Upon registration, the worker signals that its readiness to the client, which enables the mocking.

### Integrity check

Mock Service Worker distributes the Service Worker JavaScript module (`mockServiceWorker.js`) that is responsible for requests interception. However, since it's not technically possible to register the worker from `node_modules` directory, the library exposes a designated [CLI](/docs/cli/init) to copy the worker file into your public directory. This makes the worker file an _external dependency_ of the library. The worker file itself is subjected to improvements and bug fixes, yet since it's not linked to the library's distributive, the is no way to implicitly apply any updates, or even know when such are necessary.

To handle this, the library uses a concept of _integrity check_. There is an MD5 hash string generated from the worker's file content that is distributed inside the worker. When the `start()` function is called, it compares the integrity checksum between the currently registered worker (in your public directory) and the latest published worker file (from `node_modules`). Whenever there is a mismatch between the checksums, it prints an error and suggests to update your local copy of the worker file to ensure you have all the latest changes.

### Clients map

Internally, the worker file keeps a map of all controlled `clients`. This allows to control mocking per-client (page) basis, allowing one tab of the same project to have mocking, while the other doesn't.

> Whenever a client is closed, it communicates the close event to the worker. When the last client is closed, the worker unregisters itself to prevent affecting unrelated pages on the same host.

## Usage

```js showLineNumbers
// src/mocks.js
import { setupWorker } from 'msw'

const worker = setupWorker(...mocks)
worker.start()
```
