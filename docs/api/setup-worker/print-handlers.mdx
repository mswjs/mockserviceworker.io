Prints the list of currently active request handlers into the browser's console.

## Example

```js
// handlers.js
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'

const worker = setupWorker(
  rest.get('/user/:userId', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({ id: req.params.userId }))
  }),
)

worker.start()
```

To list all the active request handlers run the following command:

```js
worker.printHandlers()
```

> Consider storing the worker instance on the global `window` object to access its methods anytime from the browser.

Each request handler outputted into the console contains the following information:

- Request method (`GET`) and path (`/user/:userId`).
- Declaration frame (`handlers.js@5:8`) you can click to navitate to the place in your code where you declare this handler.
