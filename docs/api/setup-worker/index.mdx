title: setupWorker()

---

A function that configures a Service Worker instance with a given mock definition, and returns the API to control that worker instance.

## Examples

The `setupWorker()` function is used for client-side mocking. You usually create a worker instance and activate it by calling the `start()` method on the returned API.

```js showLineNumbers focusedLines=3,16
import { setupWorker, rest } from "msw";

const worker = setupWorker(
  // Provide request handlers
  rest.get("/user/:userId", (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.json({
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Maverick",
      })
    );
  })
);

// Start the Mock Service Worker
worker.start();
```
