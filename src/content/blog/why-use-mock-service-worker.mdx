I doubt you can build a meaningful application without communicating with some APIs one way or the other. Whenever you do, you reach out to API mocking to establish proper boundaries in testing and even help you prototype and debug more efficiently. As often happens in JavaScript, there are a lot of options to choose from to add API mocking to your project. I happened to build one of those options, and so today I'd like to talk about why you would even consider using Mock Service Worker in your project.

> This isn't a comparison post. We have quite an extensive [Comparison](https://mswjs.io/docs/comparison) between MSW and its alternatives in the documentation already. I see no reason to repeat that. Instead, let's focus on what makes MSW stand out in a general sense.

## Integrity

You may hear me refer to MSW as "seamless" sometimes. That is not a fancy marketing term. The library rightfully deserves it by promoting, encouraging, and implementing mocking strategies that do not compromise the integrity of your application. Here's what I mean by that.

In my Egghead article series on API mocking, I go into depth on how [Request interception algorithms work](https://egghead.io/blog/understanding-api-mocking-request-interception-algorithms). In a nutshell, it's been universally accepted that stubbing the request client is the way to go. It looks something like this in practice:

```jsx
const originalFetch = window.fetch

window.fetch = async (input, init) => {
  const mockedResponse = await resolveFromMocks(new Request(input, init))

  if (mockedResponse) {
    return mockedResponse
  }

  return originalFetch(input, init)
}
```

While this, indeed, achieves request interception and API mocking, request client stubbing introduces a significant change to your application. Think about it this way: in a mocked response scenario, _no actual logic of `window.fetch` is being run_.

You would be mistaken to assume you can throw that logic away. Say, you are accidentally making a `Request` that doesn't make sense:

```js
fetch('/resource', { body: 'Hello world' })
```

**If this was a real reques**t, it would throw an exception:

```
Request with GET/HEAD method cannot have body.
```

This is the Fetch API trying to warn you about a mistake you're making. Warning by crashing your app. You shouldn't be making requests like that but if you stub `window.fetch`, suddenly, you can.

Let's take a look at another example. Imagine you made a typo in the request URL:

```js
fetch('htps:/example.com/resource')
```

That's certainly not the right protocol scheme and, as a consequence, an invalid URL.

**If this was a real request**, the `window.fetch` would let you know about this mistake by throwing an exception:

```
URL scheme "htps" is not supported.
```

But since you are in the self-inflicted alternative universe of a stubbed `window.fetch`, it won't ever error because the browser logic that does the URL validation is never called, and the only place this will crash is in production.

Notice a repeating pattern here: **If this was a real request**. Because when stubbing request clients, you are no longer making real requests. Requests that your application will make for the users. Gone. In fact, _you are not making any requests at all_. You can see that by opening the Network tab in your DevTools and see it remain empty as your application "communicates" with the mocked API.

### How MSW solves integrity

Since its inception, MSW heavily relies on JavaScript standards. The premise of the library, which is also 66% of its name, is the usage of the Service Worker API to intercept requests in the browser.

Unlike conventional request client stubbing, the Service Worker allows us to intercept requests _after_ they are being dispatched by your application. This means _after_ `window.fetch` is finished its business. Such requests actually happen, are observable in the network traffic, and are responded to with mocks on the browser level.

As a free win, because the interception happens "higher", MSW is oblivious to the request clients you may be using. Whether it's the native `window.fetch`, or `axios`, or Apollo—everything results in a network entry, and everything gets intercepted by the Service Worker without stubs and patches.

There is simply no better, cleaner way to intercept and manage your HTTP communication in the browser.

## Reusability

It pains me to see that in 2024 API mocking is still considered a feature of particular testing frameworks. I assure you, it is not. Not only API mocking deserves its standalone layer, but it shines prominently once you give it one.

I respect and admire the work so many teams did to give us API mocking capabilities in JavaScript. I learned a lot from those APIs. But we must acknowledge that repeating oneself over and over to achieve the same thing in different frameworks is a primary symptom of inefficiency.

If you're testing an average JavaScript application, you are writing integration tests with tools like Vitest, and also end-to-end tests with something like Playwright. Both are exceptional tools. And both give you unique tools to become in control of the network. The problem is, those tools are looking at different directions. They aren't the same, just as those frameworks aren't the same. They are incompatible. They offer close to no reusability, forcing you to concoct custom JSON fixtures to them reuse but there's more to the network logic than static fixtures.

### How MSW solves reusability

At the moment of writing this, MSW is the only tool in JavaScript that allows you to reuse API mocks across the entire stack. It has been such a tool for the half a decade of its existence and I have a strong feeling that won't change much in another decade to come.

The point of MSW is a single layer of the network. You describe the API behavior you want using [Request handlers](https://mswjs.io/docs/basics/intercepting-requests), and then integrate them into whichever environment you want. "Environment", not "tooling".

Going environment-first might have been the most defining decision in MSW. By doing so, it automatically supports any tools that exist and any tools that ever will exist. MSW works in the browser and in Node.js. That is quite literally 100% of any JavaScript tooling out there.

You can use MSW with Jest and Vitest, Cypress and Playwright, Storybook and Electron, Express and Fastify… The best part about this is there's no need for any plugins or configurations. No `msw-vitest-adapter`. A single environment—a single point of entry. I truly believe this is what API mocking experience should be.

## Standardization

For a long while, the client-side and the server-side JavaScript used to live in different worlds. The way you make requests in the browser was as different as it could get compared to requests in Node.js. That resulted in API mocking libraries contriving a bunch of APIs to help you control the network in both environments. They required you to learn and memorize all those contrived APIs to achieve your goal.

Presently, the Fetch API is a great common ground to join the client and the server. There is no longer need to design custom request and response representation for the purposes of mocking. If anything, that is rather harmful for developers. I certainly don't want MSW users to do anything but learn how requests and responses work in JavaScript, not in MSW.

### How MSW solves standardization

[Since the 2.0 release](https://mswjs.io/blog/introducing-msw-2.0), MSW fully embraces the Fetch API standard and allows you to handle requests and responses according to the Fetch API specification. This works for both browser and Node.js, and finally makes you learn JavaScript, and not some third-party library.

This means less need to consult the docs, fewer things to learn, and more things to reuse and carry out from MSW and into other aspects of development. I believe it's the purpose of any tool to help its users to become better developers while they achieve their goal. And that is the key philosophy behind design decisions in MSW.

## Transparency

This may be the weakest point practically-speaking, but I find tremendous value in MSW being truly open source. There's no company behind it, the library isn't a gateway to lure you to a paid product or service. We certainly suffer a lot from that financially but hey, at least you get a transparent development, community support, and assurance the library always puts **your** interests first.
