## Call signature

```ts
function passthrough(): Response {}
```

import { PageCard } from '../../../components/react/pageCard'
import { CodeBracketSquareIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'

<PageCard
  icon={CodeBracketSquareIcon}
  url="https://github.com/mswjs/msw/tree/main/src/core/passthrough.ts"
  title="passthrough.ts"
  description="Source code for the `passthrough` namespace."
/>

## Usage

```js /passthrough/ {6}
import { http, passthrough, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/resource', ({ request }) => {
    if (request.headers.has('x-my-header')) {
      return passthrough()
    }

    return HttpResponse.text('Mocked response')
  }),
]
```

Unlike [`bypass()`](/docs/api/bypass), the `passthrough()` function _does not result in an additional request_, and is designed to explicitly pass through an intercepted request within the response resolver. Because of this, the `passthrough()` function cannot be used to perform an additional request, only to handle an already intercepted one.
