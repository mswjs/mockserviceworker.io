title: Network errors
description: Reproduce a network error response.
---

Use the `HttpResponse.error()` static method (the mirror of [`Response.error()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/error_static)) to create a network error response.

Unlike [server error responses](/docs/basics/mocking-responses#mocking-error-responses), network errors reject the request promise and represent a failed request operation. Some of the examples of network errors include:

- Connectivity issues (e.g. the client became offline);
- DNS lookup failures (e.g. connecting to a non-existing host);

## Example

```js {6}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/resource', () => {
    // Respond with a network error.
    return HttpResponse.error()
  }),
]
```
