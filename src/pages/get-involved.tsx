          Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for considering contributing to Mock Service Worker.
          We are an open source project, so anybody is welcome to suggest ideas,
          raise issues, and provide improvements to MSW and all the surrounding
          repositories. It is by the power of incredible contributors we are

          around the globe. Now you are one step closer to becoming a part of
          our community!

        <Text>
          There are multiple ways to help, and those aren't limited by
          engineering alone. We understand and respect that our contributors
          come from different technical and cultural backgrounds, and we strive
          towards a smooth contribution experience, especially if this is your
          first open source involvement ever.

            Technical writing is challenging and you could be helping by
            browsing <Link to="/docs">the project's documentation</Link> for the
            signs of improvement. For instance:
          </Text>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spot and fix typos and overly complex grammatical constructions;
            </li>
            <li>Document missing features, options, and recipes;</li>
            <li>
              Suggest any changes that would make the docs more comprehensible.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <Text>
            Each documentation page has an "<i>Edit this page</i>" link at the
            bottom, clicking on which will forward you to the respective
            Markdown file you can edit and submit a pull request on GitHub.
