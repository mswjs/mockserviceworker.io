## Can I generate request handlers on build time?

No. Source currently only supports runtime request handlers generation. That is a deliberate decision in order to prevent generated handlers from becoming build artifacts that you need to version, maintain, and remember to keep in-sync with your input type.

## Can I generate request handlers from XYZ?

Yes, you can. That doesn't mean that we need to ship a designated API for XYZ from Source. Use [`@mswjs/source`](https://github.com/mswjs/source) for inspiration to build a request generation utility, which you can then even publish to NPM for others to use!

## Can I spawn an HTTP server from Source?

No, but you can spawn an HTTP server from the request handlers using the [`@mswjs/http-middleware`](https://github.com/mswjs/http-middleware) package! Here's a brief example of how to do that:

```js {1,6-7}
import { createServer } from '@mswjs/http-middleware'
import { fromOpenApi } from '@mswjs/source/open-api'
import api from './api.spec.json'

const handlers = await fromOpenApi(api)
const server = createServer(...handlers)
server.listen(8080)
```
