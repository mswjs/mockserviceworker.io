## Step 1: Install

Add `@mswjs/source` as a dependency to your project:

```sh
npm install msw @mswjs/source --save-dev
```

> Source is meant to be used with [`msw`](https://mswjs.io/) so we will install it too.

## Step 2: Choose source

Next, decide about the source (or sources) to generate the request handlers from.

In this tutorial, we will use a network archive (`api.har`) we recorded earlier. It looks like this:

```json
{
  "log": {
    "entries": []
  }
}
```

> You can copy the contents of the HAR file above or make your own traffic recording in the browser.

Import the `fromTraffic` function from `@mswjs/source/traffic` and provide the HAR file as an argument to that function:

```js {3} /fromTraffic/
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { fromTraffic } from '@mswjs/source/traffic'
import traffic from './api.har'

export const handlers = [...fromTraffic(traffic)]
```

As a result, you will get an array of request handlers to use with MSW.

Get yourself familiar with all the available source types for this library in the "Integrations" section to your left. Here are a few of the most used sources:

import { GlobeAltIcon, DocumentTextIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'
import { PageCard } from '@mswjs/shared/components/react/pageCard'

<div className="md:grid md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-5">
  <PageCard
    icon={GlobeAltIcon}
    url="/docs/integrations/har"
    title="Network archive (HAR)"
    description="Generate request handlers from HAR files."
  />
  <PageCard
    icon={DocumentTextIcon}
    url="/docs/integrations/open-api"
    title="OpenAPI specification"
    description="Generate request handlers from OpenAPI documents."
  />
</div>

## Step 3: Integrate

Source helps you to generate request handlers but handlers themselves just describe the network. They don't intercept or mock anything.

Here's a brief example of how to enable API mocking in a Node.js process, using the request `handlers` we've generated during the previous step:

```js {2,4}
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

const server = setupServer(...handlers)
server.listen()
```
