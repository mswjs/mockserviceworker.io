Content.

## Step 1: Install

Add Source as a dependency to your project:

```sh
npm install msw @mswjs/source --save-dev
```

> Source is meant to be used with [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) so we will install it too.

## Step 2: Choose the source

For this tutorial, let's generate request handlers from a HAR file we've recorded earlier.

```js /fromTraffic/ /traffic/#v
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { fromTraffic } from '@mswjs/source'
import traffic from './api.har'

const handlers = [...fromTraffic(traffic)]
```

> The `handler.js` module is where you describe your request handlers. If you are unsure what that means, please [read this first](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started#step-2-describe).

## Step 3: Integrate

...TODO Link to MSW's Integration step. Also, example with `setupServer()` integration right here.

```js {2,4}
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

const server = setupServer(...handlers)
server.listen()
```
