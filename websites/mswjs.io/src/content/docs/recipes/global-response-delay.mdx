While you can control the response time (i.e. delay) of individual responses using the [`delay()`](/docs/api/delay) API, sometimes you want to apply a delay consistently to _all_ mocked responses. There are a couple of ways you can do that with MSW.

## Option 1: A delay passthrough handler

The request handlers you define are executed in order, which means that a single intercepted request can execute multiple request handlers (until there's one that returns a mocked response).

You can take advantage of that execution order and introduce a passthrough request handler that matches all outgoing requests and adds a delay in its response resolver without returning a mocked response.

```js {4-6} /http.all/
import { http, delay, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.all('*', async () => {
    await delay(1000)
  }),
  http.get('/user', () => {
    return HttpResponse.json({ id: 'abc-123' })
  }),
  http.post('/cart/:cartId', () => {
    return new HttpResponse(null, { status: 201 })
  }),
]
```

In the example above, both `GET /user` and `POST /cart/:cartId` requests will match the `http.all('*')` request handler, which will delay their eventual resolution by 1000ms.

This option provides you with a consistent delay across all request handlers but makes it harder to opt-out from this behavior for specific handlers (you'd have to put those _before_ the all-matching `http.all('*')`).

## Option 2: Higher-order response resolver

You can create a higher-order response resolver that encapsulates the delay logic while giving you the flexibility over which responses to delay.

```ts {6} /delay/
// withDelay.ts
import { delay, HttpResponseResolver } from 'msw'

export async function withDelay(resolver: HttpResponseResolver): HttpResponseResolver {
  return async (...args) => {
    await delay(1000)
    return resolver(...args)
  }
}
```

> You can design the `withDelay()` function as you wish. For example, instead of hard-coding the delay duration, you can expose it as an argument to the `withDelay()` function for each individual request handler to specify.

```ts /withDelay/1,3,4
// handlers.ts
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'
import { withDelay } from './withDelay'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/user', withDelay(({ request }) => {
    return HttpResponse.json({ id: 'abc-123' })
  }),
  http.post('/cart/:cartId', withDelay(({ request }) => {
    return new HttpResponse(null, { status: 201 })
  }),
  http.get('/products', () => {
    return HttpResponse.json([1, 2, 3])
  })
]
```

In the example above, the `GET /user` and `POST /cart/:cartId` requests will be delayed by 1000ms because their response resolvers are wrapped in the `withDelay()` higher-order resolver. Note that the `GET /products` request _will no have any delay_, respectively.

This option gives you more control over which responses to delay while encapsulating the delay logic within the higher-order response resolver for consistency.
