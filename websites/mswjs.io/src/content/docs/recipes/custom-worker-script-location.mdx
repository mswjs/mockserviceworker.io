title: Custom worker script location
---

## Custom worker location

By default, calling `worker.start()` will register the Service Worker script located at `/mockServiceWorker.js`. You can customize the location of the worker script using the `serviceWorker.url` option:

```js {2-6}
await worker.start({
  serviceWorker: {
    // This is useful if your application follows
    // a strict directory structure.
    url: '/assets/mockServiceWorker.js',
  },
})
```

import { Warning } from '@mswjs/shared/components/react/warning'

<Warning>
  Changing the worker script's location affects the scope at which the Service
  Worker can intercept requests. For example, serving the worker script from a
  `/assets/` directory means that only the pages served under the `/assets/`
  path and deeper can be affected by the worker (i.e. MSW).
</Warning>

## Custom worker scope

There are multiple ways to allow the worker to control pages outside of its location. Note that all of these methods imply you have access to the **development server**, which with most modern frameworks you do to some extent. These suggestions may or may not work depending on the capabilities of the framework that you're using.

### Option 1: Proxy worker request

You can create a proxy from `/mockServiceWorker.js` to any actual worker script location on the server. In that case, you can use the default `worker.start()` call without the custom worker script location options.

Here's an example of creating such a proxy request if your application is served by Express:

```js
// This proxy request allows the browser to register the
// Service Worker from the root while proxying the worker
// script file from a nested location in "/assets/".
app.get('/mockServiceWorker.js', (req, res) => {
  res.redirect('/assets/mockServiceWorker.js')
})
```

> Please consult your framework's setup to learn more about creating proxy routes.

### Option 2: `Service-Worker-Allowed` response header

You can tell the browser to ignore the default worker scope limitation by sending the `Service-Worker-Allowed` header in the response to the requested worker script.

```js {3}
app.get('/assets/mockServiceWorker.js', (req, res, next) => {
  // Allow the worker to control all the pages of the app.
  res.setHeader('Service-Worker-Allowed', '/')
  next()
})
```

The `Service-Worker-Allowed` header must be present on the response to the worker script:

```txt {3}
GET /assets/mockServiceWorker.js HTTP/1.0
content-type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8;
service-worker-allowed: /
