You can use [generator functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) (including async generators) in JavaScript to yield different responses on each subsequent request to an endpoint. This is particularly handy to describe HTTP polling.

```js /*/ /yield/ {13}
import { http, HttpResponse, delay } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/weather/:city', async function* () {
    let degree = 25

    // Add random server-side latency to emulate
    // a real-world server.
    await delay()

    while (degree < 27) {
      degree++
      yield HttpResponse.json({ degree: degree })
    }

    degree++
    return HttpResponse.json({ degree: degree })
  }),
]
```

The example above will respond with incrementing temperature degree until it reaches 28 degrees.

```json
GET /weather/london // { "degree": 26 }
GET /weather/london // { "degree": 27 }
GET /weather/london // { "degree": 28 }
// All subsequent requests will respond
// with the latest returned response.
GET /weather/london // { "degree": 28 }
```
