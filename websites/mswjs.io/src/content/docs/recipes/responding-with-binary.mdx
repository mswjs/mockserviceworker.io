title: Responding with binary
---

Provide the `ArrayBuffer` as the mocked response body to respond with that binary data.

## Browser

```js {8-10,14-18}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/images/:imageId', async ({ params }) => {
    // The easiest way to obtain a buffer in the browser
    // is to fetch the resource you need and read its body
    // as "response.arrayBuffer()".
    const buffer = await fetch(`/static/images/${params.imageId}`).then(
      (response) => response.arrayBuffer()
    )

    // Use the "HttpResponse.arrayBuffer()" shorthand method
    // to automatically infer the response body buffer's length.
    return HttpResponse.arrayBuffer(buffer, {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'image/jpeg',
      },
    })
  }),
]
```

> Don't forget to describe the MIME type of your response body in the `Content-Type` response header.

## Node.js

You can use `fetch()` to request resources and read them as `ArrayBuffer` in Node.js as well. However, you can also read any file in your file system and respond with its binary.

```js
import fs from 'node:fs'
import path from 'node:path'
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/videos/:videoId', async ({ params }) => {
    // Read a video file from the file system.
    const buffer = fs.readFileSync(
      path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'mock-assets/videos', `${videoId}.mp4`)
    )

    return HttpResponse.arrayBuffer(buffer, {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'video/mp4',
      },
    })
  }),
]
```
