A function that configures the interception of requests in a Node.js process.

Despite the word "server" in the name, it _does not_ establish any servers, operating entirely in the thread of your process.

## Node.js specifics

The `setupServer` function acts as a bridge to apply the same request handlers in Node.js, where Service Workers cannot run. Instead, it augments the standard request modules like `http` in order to react to outgoing requests and respond to them from your mock definitions.

### Precautions

Reusing the same handlers between the browser and Node.js may have certain limitations. The browser-specific API you may use in your handlers, like `location` or `localStorage`, will not be available in Node.js. It is your responsibility to polyfill those APIs in tests or use an appropriate testing environment that provides them.

## Usage

Using `setupServer` is similar to `setupWorker`. It comes down to providing it with the list of request handlers, and starting the request interception.

```js {2,5,15}
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'

// Provide the server-side API with the request handlers.
const server = setupServer(
  http.get('/user', () => {
    return HttpResponse.json({
      id: '15d42a4d-1948-4de4-ba78-b8a893feaf45',
      firstName: 'John',
    })
  })
)

// Start the interception.
server.listen()
```

import { Warning } from '@mswjs/shared/components/react/warning'

<Warning>
  Pay attention that `setupServer` is imported from `msw/node`, while the
  request handlers are imported from `msw` as usual.
</Warning>

One of the most common usages of Mock Service Worker in Node.js is during integration tests. Integrate API mocking as a part of your testing setup to make sure you start and clean up the request interception logic appropriately.

Take a look at the testing setup example using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework:

```js
// jest.setup.js
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

const server = setupServer(...handlers)

beforeAll(() => {
  // Start the interception.
  server.listen()
})

afterEach(() => {
  // Remove any handlers you may have added
  // in individual tests (runtime handlers).
  server.resetHandlers()
})

afterAll(() => {
  // Disable request interception and clean up.
  server.close()
})
```

> While we commend setting up request interception globally, as a part of your testing setup, you may also use `setupServer` in individual tests, if you want to. Just make sure to choose _one_ pattern and follow it throughout your testsâ€”multiple `setupServer` calls is **not** a good idea!
