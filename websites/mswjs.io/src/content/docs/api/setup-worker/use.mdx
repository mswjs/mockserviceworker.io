## Call signature

```js {6}
import { http } from 'msw'
import { worker } from './mocks/browser'

// Prepend a list of new handlers to this worker instance.
// Past this point, they extend the network behavior.
worker.use(http.get('/resource'), http.post('/resource'))
```

import { Info } from '@mswjs/shared/components/react/info'

<Info>
  Similar to `worker.start()`, you can spread a list of request handlers as
  arguments to the `worker.use()` method. No need to call it multiple times!
</Info>

The prepended request handlers persist on the worker as long as the current runtime exists (thus, they are often referred to as "runtime request handlers").
