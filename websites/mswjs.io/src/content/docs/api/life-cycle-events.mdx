Life-cycle events allow you to subscribe to the internal library events occurring during the request/response handling. You are unlikely to use this API directly while developing or testing with MSW. There are, however, a number of use-cases when this API can be beneficial:

- When you're building a third-party library encapsulating MSW;
- When you wish to transparently monitor requests/responses in your application;
- When you wish to explicitly wait for a certain request/response.

## Precautions

### Read-only

The life-cycle events API is **read-only**. This means that you can observe requests and responses but **cannot affect them**. If you wish to affect the request handling, consider using [`setupWorker`](/docs/api/setup-worker) and/or [`setupServer`](/docs/api/setup-server) instead.

### Clone before reading

The `request` and `response` references exposed through this API are exact Fetch API representations of the occurred requests and received responses. If you wish to read their bodies, don't forget **to clone them**.

```js
server.events.on('request:start', async ({ request }) => {
  // Read the request body as text for every request
  // that occurs in your application.
  const payload = await request.clone().text()
})
```

## Usage

The life-cycle events API is exposed under the `events` property on the worker/server instance:

```js {3,7}
// In the browser.
const worker = setupWorker(...handlers)
worker.events

// In Node.js.
const server = setupServer(...handlers)
server.events
```

> The overall shape of the API is identical between the environments.

The `events` property contains a custom event emitter intentionally restricted to only listen to the events without the ability to emit them (emitting events is performed by the library). You can use methods like `addListener()`, `once()` and `removeListener()` on the `events` object.

```js
// Observe any outgoing requests in your application.
server.events.on('request:start', ({ request, requestId }) => {
  console.log('Outgoing request:', request.method, request.url)
})
```

## Request events

### `request:start`

The `request:start` event is emitted whenever a request occurs in your application. You can access the `request` reference in the argument of the listener.

```js
worker.events.on('request:start', ({ request, requestId }) => {
  console.log('Outgoing request:', request.method, request.url)
})
```

### `request:match`

The `request:match` event is emitted whenever an intercepted request has a corresponding request handler defined.

### `request:unhandled`

The `request:unhandled` event is emitted whenever an intercepted request has no corresponding request handler defined and will be performed as-is.

### `request:end`

The `request:end` event is emitted whenever a request has ended. This event is emitted for all requests, regardless if they were handled or not.

## Response events

### `response:mocked`

The `response:mocked` event is emitted whenever a mocked response is sent. You can access both the `response` reference and the respective `request` reference in the listener to this event.

```js
server.events.on('response:mocked', ({ request, requestId, response }) => {
  console.log(
    '%s %s received %s %s',
    request.method,
    request.url,
    response.status,
    response.statusText
  )
})
```

### `response:bypass`

The `response:bypass` event is emitted whenever an original (bypassed) response is sent. Similar to the `response:mocked` event, you can access the `response` and `request` references in the listener.

## Other events

### `unhandledException`

The `unhandledException` event is emitted whenever an unhandled error is thrown within the response resolver function. You can access the relevant `request` and `requestId` in the listener to this event, as well as the thrown `error` reference.

```js
server.events.on('unhandledException', ({ request, requestId, error }) => {
  console.log('%s %s errored! See details below.', request.method, request.url)
  console.error(error)
})
```

## Removing listeners

### `removeListener()`

- `name`, _String_, the event name to remove.
- `listener`, _Function_, the event listener to remove.

```js
server.events.removeListener('request:start', requestStartListener)
```

### `removeAllListeners()`

- `name`, _String_ (Optional), the event name to remove.

When called without any arguments, `.removeAllListeners()` removes _all_ events attached to the current `worker`/`server` instance:

```js
server.events.removeAllListeners()
```

You can provide a `name` argument to only remove the listeners for the respective event:

```js
server.events.removeAllListeners('request:start')
```
