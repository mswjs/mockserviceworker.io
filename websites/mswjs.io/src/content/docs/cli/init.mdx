## Usage

```
npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR> [options]
```

## Arguments

### `PUBLIC_DIR`

A relative path to the public directory of your application.

For example, when using NextJS, the public directory is located in `/public`, and that's the path you should provide to this command:

```
npx msw init ./public
```

## Flags

### `--save`

Save the given `PUBLIC_DIR` in `package.json` for future automatic updates of the worker script.

```
npx msw init ./public --save
```

Running this command will save the `./public` directory in your `package.json`:

```json {4-6}
// package.json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "msw": {
    "workerDirectory": "./public"
  }
}
```

If this property is present, whenever you install the `msw` package, the worker script will be copied to the `msw.workerDirectory` destination automatically. This ensures the worker script being in sync with the currently installed version of the library.
