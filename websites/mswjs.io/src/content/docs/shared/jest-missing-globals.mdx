title: Jest missing globals
---

This issue is caused by your environment not having the Node.js globals for one reason or another. This commonly happens when using `jest-environment-jsdom` because it intentionally replaces built-in APIs with polyfills, breaking their Node.js compatibility.

To fix this, use the [`jest-fixed-jsdom`](https://github.com/mswjs/jest-fixed-jsdom) environment instead of `jest-environment-jsdom`.

```sh
npm i jest-fixed-jsdom
```

```js
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'jest-fixed-jsdom',
}
```

This custom environment is a superset of `jest-environment-jsdom` with the built-in Node.js modules added back. That being said, there are a lot of things that Jest/JSDOM breaks in your test environment that are problematic to fix. **This setup is a workaround**.

If you find this setup cumbersome, consider migrating to a modern testing framework, like [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), which has none of the Node.js globals issues and provides native ESM support out of the box.
